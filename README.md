This program generates 25 random points on a canvas element and displays them using WebGL. It then determines the points on the convex hull of the set of points and displays those as well.

# Getting Started

To run the program, simply open the index.html file in a web browser that supports WebGL. The points will be displayed on the canvas element, and the points on the convex hull will be displayed in red.
Dependencies

Note: This program requires a web browser with support for WebGL.

# Files

* index.html - HTML file containing the canvas element and script for the program
* style.css - CSS file for styling the canvas element

# Credits

This program was created using the WebGL API. The algorithm for determining the points on the convex hull is based on the gift wrapping algorithm.
